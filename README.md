# Trivia_Game

To make this game work, I used JavaScript, HTML, & CSS. Event listeners do play a major role in this game since it is a multiple choice game. To win this game you need 20 points, get one wrong and you lose. Any time you get a right answer the game will move on to the next card. However, get the wrong answer and the choice selected will turn red. To restart the game you simply refresh the page. 


This game will act as a mnemonic device for me and as I continue to learn, more cards on will be added. As more cards get added I plan to change the way the game looks and add more features. Background, fonts, and colors may change over time as well. As of right now the the colors I have chosen are colors I find easy to look at.
